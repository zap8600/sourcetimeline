Recreating the Source engine from Wolfenstein 3D to GoldSrc
## Why????
Mainly because I want retro games to run on platforms worse than their initial target. Plus, I can add more functionality to these games.
## Process
Since WOLFENSTEIN 3D already has [all of its source code](https://github.com/id-Software/wolf3d) public, I can rewrite it for 32-bit and 64-bit systems. Once it has full compatibility with the original WOLFENSTIEN 3D, I can use it as a base to make the DOOM engine, which will then be used to make the Quake engine and so on.
